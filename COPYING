The SuperPascal software (hereafter Software) is educational
software written by Per Brinch Hansen (hereafter  PBH).  The
Software  consists of the Manuals, Programs, and Scripts for
the programming language SuperPascal invented  by  PBH.  The
Software is stored as text in 11 files (hereafter Files).
  The Manuals, written by PBH, are stored as LaTeX text in 3
Files:

     report.tex  "The programming language SuperPascal."

     user.tex    "The SuperPascal user manual."

     notes.tex   "The SuperPascal software notes."

  The  Programs,  written by PBH, are a SuperPascal compiler
and interpreter (hereafter Compiler  and  Interpreter).  The
Programs   are   written   in   Pascal  for  Sun3  and  Sun4
workstations running Unix. The Programs are stored as Pascal
text in 6 Files:

     common.p     The common declarations used by the
                  Compiler and Interpreter.

     scan.p       The Compiler procedure that performs
                  lexical analysis.

     parse.p      The Compiler procedure that performs
                  syntax, scope, and type analysis.

     assemble.p   The Compiler procedure that assembles
                  interpreted code.

     compile.p    The Compiler program.

     interpret.p  The Interpreter program.

  The  Scripts  are  Unix  shell scripts stored as text in 2
Files:

   sun3.user  A shell script for compilation of the
              Programs on a Sun3 workstation under Unix.

   sun4.user  A shell script for compilation of the
              Programs on a Sun4 workstation under Unix.
