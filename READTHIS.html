<pre>         ANONYMOUS FTP OF THE SUPERPASCAL SOFTWARE</pre>

<pre>                     PER BRINCH HANSEN</pre>

<pre>         School of Computer and Information Science
        Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY 13244, USA</pre>

<pre>                       November 1993</pre>

<pre>These instructions describe the SuperPascal software, define
the terms and conditions for its use, and  explain  how  you
obtain the software by anonymous FTP.</pre>

<pre>                        DEFINITIONS</pre>

<pre>The SuperPascal software (hereafter Software) is educational
software written by Per Brinch Hansen (hereafter  PBH).  The
Software  consists of the Manuals, Programs, and Scripts for
the programming language SuperPascal invented  by  PBH.  The
Software is stored as text in 11 files (hereafter Files).
  The Manuals, written by PBH, are stored as LaTeX text in 3
Files:</pre>

<pre>     report.tex  "The programming language SuperPascal."</pre>

<pre>     user.tex    "The SuperPascal user manual."</pre>

<pre>     notes.tex   "The SuperPascal software notes."</pre>

<pre>  The  Programs,  written by PBH, are a SuperPascal compiler
and interpreter (hereafter Compiler  and  Interpreter).  The
Programs   are   written   in   Pascal  for  Sun3  and  Sun4
workstations running Unix. The Programs are stored as Pascal
text in 6 Files:</pre>

<pre>     common.p     The common declarations used by the
                  Compiler and Interpreter.</pre>

<pre>     scan.p       The Compiler procedure that performs
                  lexical analysis.</pre>

<pre>     parse.p      The Compiler procedure that performs
                  syntax, scope, and type analysis.</pre>

<pre>     assemble.p   The Compiler procedure that assembles
                  interpreted code.</pre>

<pre>     compile.p    The Compiler program.</pre>

<pre>     interpret.p  The Interpreter program.</pre>

<pre>  The  Scripts  are  Unix  shell scripts stored as text in 2
Files:</pre>

<pre>   sun3.user  A shell script for compilation of the
              Programs on a Sun3 workstation under Unix.</pre>

<pre>   sun4.user  A shell script for compilation of the
              Programs on a Sun4 workstation under Unix.</pre>

<pre>                    TERMS AND CONDITIONS</pre>

<pre>THE MANUALS ARE COPYRIGHTED BY PBH. THE PROGRAMS ARE IN  THE
PUBLIC DOMAIN. YOU CAN OBTAIN THE SOFTWARE BY ANONYMOUS FTP.
THE SOFTWARE IS NOT GUARANTEED FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. PBH
SUPPLIES  THE  SOFTWARE  "AS  IS"  WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OR
REPRESENTATIONS AND DOES NOT  ACCEPT  ANY  LIABILITIES  WITH
RESPECT  TO THE SOFTWARE. YOU (THE USER) ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR
SELECTING THE SOFTWARE, AND FOR THE USE AND RESULTS OBTAINED
FROM  THE  SOFTWARE. YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE INDICATES YOUR
ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS.</pre>

<pre>                  FILE TRANSFER PROCEDURE</pre>

<pre>To obtain the Software, <a href="http://brinch-hansen.net/software.shar">click here</a>. Save it in some local
directory.</pre>

<pre>  Split the archive into Files by typing</pre>

<pre>                      sh software.shar</pre>

<pre>  Your local directory should now contain the Files.</pre>

<pre>                     HOW TO GET STARTED</pre>

<pre>Transform the LaTeX files into PostScript  files  and  print
the  Manuals.  Read  "The  SuperPascal software notes" which
explain how you  compile  the  Programs  on  Sun3  and  Sun4
workstations.  Compile  the  Programs  into  two  executable
files:</pre>

<pre>               sc  An executable Compiler.
               sr  An excutable Interpreter.</pre>

<pre>  Then read "The programming language SuperPascal" and  "The
SuperPascal user manual".</pre>
